# LinkedIn Post Blocker

## Abstract

This Chrome extension hides posts on LinkedIn based on the user's chosen keywords.

## Tech Stack

This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Installation

You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

## Setup

### Chrome

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the writing icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "LinkedIn Post Blocker." From there, you can navigate to the LinkedIn homepage (linkedin.com/feed). As you scroll through your feed you shouldn't see articles that contain keywords that are included in your list. If you do, please open an issue.

## Screenshots

## Future Changes
I will port this extension to Firefox at some point in the near future.
